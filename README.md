## Coordinate Systems
It is assumed that typical usage will be gap and taper motion (without changing elevation or tilt).  PROG02 is used for gap+taper motion.  PROG03 is used for elevation+tilt motion.  PROG04 is used for combined motion gap+taper+elevation+tilt.  These will use coordinate systems &2, &3, and &4 respectively.  Position reporting for all coordinate systems is done in PLC18 to avoid duplicate code.
