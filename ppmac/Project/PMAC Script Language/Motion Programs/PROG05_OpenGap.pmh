/*
   This program is only to be used in the case that an open gap signal is detected.
   The aim is to open the gap with zero taper either to the limit switch or to
   kMAXGAP.  This is done so at the defined speed of kOpenGapSpeed.  EPICS should
   not have access to this program or associated coordinate system.
